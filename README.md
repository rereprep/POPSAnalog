# POPSAnalog
This is a POPS plugin to enable Analog Controller Mode for PS1 Emulator (POPS) on a PSP GO by using the built-in PSP buttons and analog stick. It needs a Dualshock 3 connected to your PSP GO for one-time setup. 

Set your PS3 controller settings to Digital mode (Yes, Digital not Analog, read the linked tutorial for further info), set Assign Controller Ports to Controller 1 for both PSP System Controller and PS3 System Controller, set Assign Buttons to Custom and remap the PSP buttons as you wish. Do not remap the analog stick as it will be already in use. After that, enable the plugin and restart your game. Please read this thread to use it effectively. viewtopic.php?f=24&t=42163

With the version 0.2, i decided to use the built-in remapping feature of PSP, so the plugin will just pass the analog stick info. The rest will be done by Assign Buttons - Custom section.

Get the attachment for the plugin and the source. This plugin wouldn't exist without DS3 Remapper. viewtopic.php?f=28&t=39588

Feel free to improve the plugin.
